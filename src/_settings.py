############# preference settings:

### DEFAULT_SHARPS controls whether accidental ('black') notes are spelled
### with sharps or flats by default in the absence of other information.
### normally such distinguishing information is available: for example,
### the tonic of a key has an informed sharp/flat preference based on the
### circle of fifths, and the chords of that key inherit this preference, but
### in the simple case of "Note('C') + 1", this setting determines the result.
DEFAULT_SHARPS = True

### PREFER_UNICODE_ACCIDENTALS controls whether the default behaviour
### when printing sharp and flat signs are the normal keyboard-typable
### characters '#' and 'b' (if False)
### or the unicode characters '‚ôØ' and '‚ô≠' (if True)
PREFER_UNICODE_ACCIDENTALS = True
### both are treated as valid input options in either case,
### this only affects what the program outputs to screen

### DEFAULT_PROGRESSION_DIACRITICS controls whether Progressions are
### displayed with informative marks underneath chords that are out-of-scale,
### or that are borrowed from a related scale.
### e.g. the progression ii-V-i in major would show a diacritic
### under the i chord, to show that it is not in the major scale.
DEFAULT_PROGRESSION_DIACRITICS = True
### DEFAULT_PROGRESSION_MARKERS is related, and controls whether
### chords in progressions are shown with informative prefix markers
### that indicate *which* related scale a chord is borrowed from.
### e.g. the progression ii-V-i in minor would be shown: ·¥πii ·¥¥V i
### with 'M' to indicate the ii chord is from melodic minor,
### and 'H' to indicate the V chord is from harmonic minor
DEFAULT_PROGRESSION_MARKERS = False


# orpyus musical objects use little unicode MARKERS in their string methods
# to identify them at a glance. the default markers are defined here, so you
# can change them if you don't like them:
MARKERS = { # class markers used to identify musical object types:
            'Note': '‚ô©',
      'OctaveNote': '‚ô™',
   'AbstractChord': '‚ô´ ',
           'Chord': '‚ô¨ ',
           'Scale': 'ùÑ¢ ',
             'Key': 'ùÑû ',

             # chord-movement markers used in progression analysis:
             'right': '‚áæ ', # '>',
             'up': '‚Üø', #'‚Üë' # '‚áß'
             'down': '‚áÉ', # '‚Üì' # '‚á©'
            }



### BRACKETS are used similarly to markers, but placed around the objects they contain:
BRACKETS = { 'Interval': ['‚Äπ', '‚Ä∫'],
         'IntervalList': ['ùÑÅ', ' ùÑÅ'],
             'NoteList': ['ùÑÉ', ' ùÑÇ'],
              'Quality': ['~', '~'],
       'ChordModifier' : ['‚âà', '‚âà'],
         'ChordFactors': ['¬¶ ', ' ¬¶'],
            'ChordList': ['ùÑÉ ', ' ùÑÇ'],
          'Progression': ['ùÑÜ ', ' ùÑá'],    #['ùÑÉ ', ' ùÑÇ'],
     'ChordProgression': ['ùÑÜ ', ' ùÑá'],    # ['‚ïü', '‚ï¢'],
               'Guitar': ['„Äö', ' „Äõ'],
  'chromatic_intervals': ['[', ']'],  # displayed around chromatic intervals / scale factors
   'non_key_chord_root': ['<', '>'],  # displayed around KeyChords whose root is not in the key
            }

### DIACRITICS are used to mark certain chord and note names like brackets, but more compactly
DIACRITICS = { 'ScaleDegree': '\u0311', # caret above integer (a common convention)
               ### displayed in the notelists of chords:
               'octave_above': '\u0307', # dot above
               'octave_below': '\u0323', # dot below
               '2_octaves_above': '\u0308', # 2 dots above (diaresis)
               '2_octaves_below': '\u0324', # 2 dots below
               ### displayed in matching_keys and similar functions:
               'note_not_in_input': '\u0332', # underline
               'chord_in_related_scale': '\u0323', # dot below
               'chord_not_in_scale': '\u0332', # underline
               }

SCALE_MARKS = { # near natural major:
             'natural minor': '', # i.e. parallel minor
             'harmonic major': '·¥¥',
             'melodic major':  '·¥π',
             'lydian':        '·¥∏ ∏',
             'mixolydian':    '·¥πÀ£',

             # near natural minor:
             'natural minor': '', # i.e. parallel minor
             'harmonic minor': '·¥¥',
             'melodic minor':  '·¥π',
             'dorian': '·¥∞·µí',
             'phrygian': '·¥æ ∞',

             'parallel': '·µñ', # parallel scale generally
             }


### CHARACTERS are used in lists to compactly denote certain traits
CHARACTERS = {   'true': '+',    # e.g. displayed in 'Tertian' column if a chord is tertian
             'somewhat': '~',    # e.g. displayed in 'Tertian' column if inverted-tertian
     'chromatic_degree': 'c',    # displayed instead of integer ScaleDegree for a non-degree (chromatic) interval
        'unknown_chord': '?',    # displayed after root for a chord of unknown type, e.g. C? chord
  'unknown_superscript': 'ÀÄ',    # as unknown_chord, but used where superscripts are used (e.g. progressions)
 'compound_slash_chord': '!',    # displayed after compound slash chords like Am/G
       'extended_chord': 'À£',    # displayed after unnamed extended chords, i.e. CGE as compound Cmaj
                   }



############# tuning settings:

### TUNING_MODE controls which system of tuning is used to
### calculate note/interval pitches. must be one of 'JUST' or 'EQUAL':
TUNING_MODE = 'JUST'

# under JUST-intonation tuning, intervals are built from clean integer ratios.
# (in this case, restricted to ratios allowed by 5-limit tuning, i.e. powers of 2*3*5 )
# under EQUAL-temperament tuning, semitones are spaced equally on a log scale.


############# performance settings:

### PRE_CACHE determines whether common Chords/Scales are pre-initialised
### and added to cache when the entire library is imported.
### this adds a small overhead to the time taken to initialise the library,
### but feels a little nicer for interactive use.
PRE_CACHE_CHORDS = True   # applies to both Chords and AbstractChords
PRE_CACHE_SCALES = True   # applies to both Scales and Keys
# Notes and Intervals are always pre-cached, since there are so few, they are
# cheap to init, and they get initialised often inside other class internals.

# DYNAMIC_CACHING determines if Intervals/Chords/Scales etc. continue to be
# actively cached after import, whenever an un-cached object is initialised.
# the difference should be imperceptible for interactive use, but setting to True
# is strongly recommended for any kind of high-throughput musical number crunching,
# and should significantly improve both run-speed and memory efficiency.
DYNAMIC_CACHING = True
