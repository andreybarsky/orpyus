############# preference settings:

### DEFAULT_SHARPS controls whether accidental ('black') notes are spelled
### with sharps or flats by default in the absence of other information.
### normally such distinguishing information is available: for example,
### the tonic of a key has an informed sharp/flat preference based on the
### circle of fifths, and the chords of that key inherit this preference, but
### in the simple case of "Note('C') + 1", this setting determines the result.
DEFAULT_SHARPS = False

# orpyus musical objects use little unicode MARKERS in their string methods
# to identify them at a glance. the default markers are defined here, so you
# can change them if you don't like them:
MARKERS = { 'Note': '♩',
      'OctaveNote': '♪',
   'AbstractChord': '♫ ',
           'Chord': '♬ ',
           'Scale': '𝄢 ',
             'Key': '𝄞 ',
            }

# BRACKETS are used similarly to markers, but placed around the objects they contain:
BRACKETS = { 'Interval': ['‹', '›'],
         'IntervalList': ['𝄁', ' 𝄁'],
             'NoteList': ['𝄃', ' 𝄂'],
              'Quality': ['~', '~'],
       'ChordModifier' : ['≈', '≈'],
         'ChordFactors': ['¦ ', ' ¦'],
          'Progression': ['𝄆 ', ' 𝄇'],    #['𝄃 ', ' 𝄂'],
     'ChordProgression': ['𝄆 ', ' 𝄇'],    # ['╟', '╢'],
               'Guitar': ['〚', ' 〛'],


}

############# performance settings:

### PRE_CACHE determines whether common Chords/Scales are pre-initialised
### and added to cache when the entire library is imported.
### this adds a small overhead to the time taken to initialise the library,
### but feels a little nicer for interactive use.
PRE_CACHE_CHORDS = True   # applies to both Chords and AbstractChords
PRE_CACHE_SCALES = True   # applies to both Scales and Keys
### Notes and Intervals are always pre-cached, since there are so few, they are
### cheap to init, and they get initialised often inside other class internals.

# DYNAMIC_CACHING determines if Intervals/Chords/Scales etc. continue to be
# actively cached after import, whenever an un-cached object is initialised.
# the difference should be imperceptible for interactive use, but setting to True
# is strongly recommended for any kind of high-throughput musical number crunching,
# and should significantly improve both run-speed and memory efficiency.
DYNAMIC_CACHING = True
