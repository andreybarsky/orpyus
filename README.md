# Notes 

The `notes.Note` class represents abstract musical notes not associated with a specific octave: C, C#, D, through to B.  
When Note objects are displayed as a string, they look like: `‚ô©C`

Notes can be initialised from a string, such as: `Note('Db')` or `Note('F#')`,  
or by an integer position, indexed starting from C, such as: `Note(0)` or `Note(7)` (which return `‚ô©C` and `‚ô©G` respectively)

There is also an `OctaveNote` subclass that represents notes in a specific octave, played in a specific pitch: `OctaveNote('C4')`  
These can also be initialised by calling a base Note object, with the octave as argument: `Note('C')(4)`  

The `notes` module includes all the notes of the chromatic scale pre-initialised for easy access:  
- `chromatic_scale`  
  - `[‚ô©C, ‚ô©Db, ‚ô©D, ‚ô©Eb, ‚ô©E, ‚ô©F, ‚ô©Gb, ‚ô©G, ‚ô©Ab, ‚ô©A, ‚ô©Bb, ‚ô©B]`  
- `Db`  
  - `‚ô©Db`  

#### Note transposition
Notes can be transposed by addition or subtraction with integers, which shifts them up or down by that many semitones:  
- `Note('C') + 4`  
  - `‚ô©E`  
- `Note('Eb') - 10`  
  - `‚ô©F`  
- `OctaveNote('Eb5') - 10`  
  -  `‚ô™F4`  

#### Note distance
Subtracting a Note from another Note returns the semitone distance between them as an Interval:
- `Note('C') - Note('E')`  
  - `<4:Major Third>`  
- `Note('C')(5) - Note('E')(4)`  
  - `<8:Minor Sixth>`  


# Intervals

The `intervals.Interval` class represents spaces between notes, as a value in integer semitones.  
When Interval objects are displayed as a string, they look like: `<4:Major Third>`

Intervals can be initialised from an integer value, foe example: 
- `Interval(4)`  
- `Interval(-12)`  
Doing so infers the interval's degree within a scale (such as 'third' or 'fourth') as well as its quality (such as 'major', 'minor', or 'perfect').

There is also an `IntervalDegree` subclass that represents intervals of an explicit degree, such as thirds or fourths, useful for chord detection later.  
When displayed as a string, these look like: `¬´8:Augmented Fifth¬ª`  
Finally, there is a `ExtendedInterval` subclass that represents explicit ninths, elevenths, and so on, used for fancy jazz chords.

The `intervals` module includes pre-initialised IntervalDegree objects for all the theoretical non-negative intervals used in music theory (up to perfect 11ths), under a wide range of common aliases, e.g.:  
- `Maj3`  
  - `¬´4:Major Third¬ª`  
- `DiminishedSeventh`  
  - `¬´9:Diminished Seventh¬ª`  
- `P5`  
  - `¬´7:Perfect Fifth¬ª`

#### Interval arithmetic
Intervals can be added or subtracted with other Intervals, or plain integers, the result of which is another Interval with the desired value:
- `Interval(4) + Interval(3)`  
  - `<7:Perfect Fifth>`  
- `Interval(4) - 1`  
  - `<3:Minor Third>`  
- `Interval(7) - Interval(2)`  
  - `<5:Perfect Fourth>`  

#### Interval inversion
Intervals can be negative, but the negation of an Interval specifically returns its enharmonic inversion. Compare:
- `Interval(7)`  
  - `<7:Perfect Fifth>`  
- `Interval(-7)`  
  - `<-7:Perfect Fifth (descending)>`  
- `-Interval(7)`  
  - `<-5:Perfect Fourth (descending)>`  

#### Interval equivalence
The `==` operator compares enharmonic equivalence between Intervals:
- `Interval(4) == Interval(8)`  
  - `False`  
- `Interval(4) == Interval(16)`  
  - `True`  
- `Dim5 == Aug4`  
  - `True`  
- `Interval(7) == Interval(-5) == -Interval(7)`  
  - `True`  

# Chords

The `chords.Chord` class represents collections of notes as theoretical chords.
When Chord objects are displayed as a string, they look like: `‚ô¨ F#m [‚ô©F#, ‚ô©A, ‚ô©C#]`  

Chords can be initialised in a few ways:  
- Passing a theoretical chord name as a single argument:
  - `Chord('F#m')`
- Passing a chord tonic as first argument, and a chord quality as second argument, which is assumed to be major if not specified:
  - `Chord('F#', 'minor')`  
- Passing an iterable of Notes (or objects that can be cast to Notes, such as note names), which can be a list or tuple or even a string:
  -  `Chord(['F#', 'A', 'C#'])`  
  -  `Chord('F#AC#'])`  

The Chord class is clever enough to understand a wide range of common aliases, such that:

# Keys

The `scales.Key` represents theoretical musical keys, defined by a tonic note and a mode or quality.
When Key objects are displayed as a string, they look like: `ùÑûF#m`

Keys can be initialised from a tonic Note (or string that can be cast to Note), and a quality, which is assumed to be major if not specified. These can be expressed as a single string argument, or split between tonic and quality:  
- `Key('F#', 'minor')`  
- `Key('F# minor')`  

As with chords, the Key class understands a wide range of aliases:
- `Key('F#m')`  
- `Key('F#min')`  
- `Key('F# natural minor')`  
- `Key('F# aeolian')`  

Keys contain an attribute `scale`, a list of the notes that belong to that key:
- `Key('F#m').scale`  
  - ` [‚ô©F#, ‚ô©G#, ‚ô©A, ‚ô©B, ‚ô©C#, ‚ô©D, ‚ô©E]`  

And an attribute `chords`, a list of the triads built on those notes:
- `Key('F#m').chords`  
  - `[‚ô¨ F#m [‚ô©F#, ‚ô©A, ‚ô©C#],`  
   ` ‚ô¨ G#dim [‚ô©G#, ‚ô©B, ‚ô©D],`  
   ` ‚ô¨ A [‚ô©A, ‚ô©C#, ‚ô©E],`  
   ` ‚ô¨ Bm [‚ô©B, ‚ô©D, ‚ô©F#],`  
   ` ‚ô¨ C#m [‚ô©C#, ‚ô©E, ‚ô©G#],`  
   ` ‚ô¨ D [‚ô©D, ‚ô©F#, ‚ô©A],`  
   ` ‚ô¨ E [‚ô©E, ‚ô©G#, ‚ô©B]]`
